# Definitions

`Collection`: the combination of date, observer and group. 

`Session`: a focal animal session.

# Start up

Once the app is started, you will see a screen where you can either start a new day (with setting observer, date and group), or you can load some existing data. 
The latter is probably only relevant if the app (or the browser) crashed or accidentally terminated and you want to resume a session.

If you do indeed want to resume a session you can choose from the dropdown menu, or if you want to play with the feature, you can simply copy two example days which then illustrate how it works.
One of the two examples was broken off during an ongoing focal session (in fact during a grooming bout). 
The other example has two complete (finished) sessions.

There can be only one collection per observer, day and group.

# Census
By default, the group selected for the day will appear in the census pane. 
All individuals in that table will be available as nearest neighbours when doing an NN 'scan'.

It is possible to do a census on *one* additional group by clicking the 'additional group' button.
Those individuals will *not* be available for the NN data.
If there is an individual in this second group that you want to include in the NN data, it needs to be added in the top table via the 'add new row' button.
